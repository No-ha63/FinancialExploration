This project aims to get an introduction to some computational techniques in mathematical/quantitative finace. 
The techniques and subjects included are:
1) Monte Carlo Stock Modeling
2) Jump Diffusion Stock Modeling
3) VaR
4) CVaR
5) Option Pricing using Monte Carlo and Black Scholes
6) Portfolio Optimization using Sharpe Ratio

Future Plans:
1) Make a jupyter file of inspiration and background
2) Model Portfolio and calcuate VaR/CVaR for portfolio

Ways to improve:
1) Model with Stochastic Volitility
2) Use machine learning for predictions
3) develop a trading strategy
