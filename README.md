This project aims to get an introduction to some computational techniques in mathematical/quantitative finace. 
The techniques and subjects included are:
1) Monte Carlo Stock Modeling
2) Jump Diffusion Stock Modeling
3) Comparison of Monte Carlo and Jump Diffusion
4) VaR
5) CVaR
6) Option Pricing using Monte Carlo and Black Scholes
7) Portfolio Optimization using Sharpe Ratio

Future Plans:
1) Make a jupyter file of inspiration and background
2) Model Portfolio and calcuate VaR/CVaR for portfolio

Ways to improve:
1) Model with Stochastic Volitility
2) Use machine learning for predictions
3) develop a trading strategy
